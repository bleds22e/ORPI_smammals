## Data Exploration

Explore the 4 CSV files from the Access Database.

```{r}
# List all CSV files in the folder
csv_files <- list.files("../data/", pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

# Loop through each file
for (file in csv_files) {
  # Extract the filename without the .csv extension
  file_name <- tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(file))
  
  # Read the CSV file and assign it to a variable with the extracted name
  assign(file_name, read.csv(file, stringsAsFactors = FALSE), envir = .GlobalEnv)
}
```

### Questions

In RodentDetail, multiple columns have numbers but no identifying information. This could be a factor of how they are being extracted from Access?
